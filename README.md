Creat regres model for prediction time of working CNN model


How you can see in 'regres_model.ipynb', when we made full random dataset, best models are showing R-Squared = 0, and RMSE 6,58, when target metric have spread 22.
Max corr 0.06
From this result I can see what where is no bonding beetwin all metrics and target.
So it need to find new way to do metris and target. Random doesn't work.
All this work in dir - 'sandbox'
